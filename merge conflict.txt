1) what is a merge conflict ?

ANSWER-A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. 

2) where is the conflict.how to identify?

ANSWERS-Conflicts will most likely happen when working in a team environment.

3) how to resolve the conflict ?
 
ANSWERS- 1: Changes are in the Same Region of the File
         When Git cannot perform an auto-merge because changes are in the same region,
         it indicates the conflicting regions with special characters. 
         The character sequences are like this:
         a.<<<<<<<
         b.=======
         c.>>>>>>>
        Everything between <<<<<<< and ======= are your local changes. These changes are not in the remote repository yet.
        All the lines between ======= and >>>>>>> are the changes from the remote repository or another branch. 
        There are a few steps that could reduce the steps needed to resolve merge conflicts in Git.

1.e easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes
2.ter editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content
3.e final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command
4.t will create a new merge commit to finalize the merge

 Git commands that may play a significant role in resolving conflicts.
